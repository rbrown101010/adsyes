## Creating Ads 
I want to create as many ads as possible per week. 
This will require scripting, concepting, filming and editing as many videos as possible. 
- Scripting: is the writing of the ads. The scripts should be based on our best ads, and competitors best ads. 
- Concepting: involves placing visuals over the video and key B-roll. Since we’re talking about building apps we will need a lot of shots of the apps and apps being made. 
- Filming: Will be me (Riley) or other creators filming these
- Editing: Editing involves taking the Video + Script + Concept and turning it into a finished video.
## Information that we will need for this: 
**Assets:**
1. High performing Ads from Competitors (And the scripts)
2. High performing Ads from Us (And the scripts)
3. Database of Broll we have in Archive
4. List of Broll that needs to be taken
5. Written background of the product
**Batch Objectives:**
 6. Campaign Objective
 7. List of things to mention
