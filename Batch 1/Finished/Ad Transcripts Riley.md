My name is Riley Brown. I'm the cofounder of Vibecode.
I built this app because
# **Mobile**
## ==Stop Paying Developers==
I kept seeing people pay developers 10, 15, sometimes $20,000 for a custom iOS app.
They'd wait months and half the time it didn't even work right.
So I built vibecode.dev.
You just type whatever your app idea is and the most powerful AI coding models in the world start building your app.
You can test it, add a database, or even add payments so people can pay for your app.
I built this so anyone can get a professional app just by describing it and save five figures.
Try Vibecode for free.

## ==Real Apps Not Web Demos==
Everyone's out here vibe coding websites and little web demos.
But nobody's building real apps.
Like actual apps that go on the App Store.
That's why our team built vibecode.dev.
You just describe the app you want and the AI writes real native code, not some janky web wrapper.
You can add a database, push notifications, even a paywall so users can pay you and all of this literally takes 5 minutes.
I built this tool because getting a real app shouldn't take months.
It should take minutes, and you don't need any coding experience. 
Try Vibecode now. 

## ==The $200 App==
I used to see people get quoted $12,000 to build a simple app.
Twelve thousand dollars.
That's insane.
So we built vibecode.dev to fix that.
You just describe what you want and the AI builds the whole thing.
Real native code, a database, even a payment system so users can subscribe.
It looks like a real developer built it.
And the whole thing can cost less than $50 and you can have it built in one hour.
We built this because nobody should have to pay thousands of dollars for an app.
Go to vibecode.dev and try it.

## ==Founder No CTO==
Everyone says you need a technical cofounder to launch a startup.
That you can't build an app without a developer on your team.
I didn't think that was true, so we built vibecode.dev.
You describe your how the app should look and feel and then AI builds it.
Database, user auth, push notifications, even a paywall with RevenueCat.
People are launching apps in a weekend.
No cofounder, no agency, no five-figure invoice.
If you're a founder sitting on an idea because you can't code, go to vibecode.dev.
You don't need a CTO.
You need vibecode.

## ==Just Describe It==
Hi my name's Riley and I built an app that lets you build apps.
I know that sounds crazy but hear me out.
You go to vibecode.dev, describe whatever app you want to make, and AI builds the entire thing for you.
Real native app.
Not a website pretending to be an app.
You can add a database, payments, push notifications, whatever you need.
People are building apps that look like they hired a whole dev team and it's taking them minutes.
I built this because I think everyone deserves to bring their ideas to life.
Go to vibecode.dev and try it for free.

## ==Just Describe It V2==
What if I told you that you could describe an app in plain English and have it built in minutes?
No code. No developer. No design skills.
That's exactly what vibecode.dev does.
My name's Riley, I'm one of the cofounders, and we built this because building an app used to be impossible for most people.
You needed to know Swift or React Native or pay someone who does.
Now you just type what you want. The AI handles everything.
Database, payments, push notifications, the whole thing.
And it's a real native app. Not a website in disguise.
Go to vibecode.dev and try it. It's free to start.

## ==Test It On Your Phone in 10 Minutes==
One of the coolest things about vibecode.dev is how fast you go from idea to holding the app in your hand.
You describe your app, the AI builds it, and within minutes you're testing it on your actual phone.
Not a screenshot. Not a Figma mockup. A real app running on your device.
We built Vibecode because I think the moment you can touch your own app is when it becomes real.
No Xcode, no provisioning profiles, none of that.
Just describe it and test it.
Go to vibecode.dev and see what I mean.

## ==Test It On Your Phone in 10 Minutes V2==
I showed someone vibecode.dev for the first time last week.
They described a simple workout tracker.
Three minutes later they were holding it on their phone.
They looked at me like I was lying.
That's the thing about vibecode. 
It doesn't give you a preview or a wireframe.
It gives you a real app on your real phone.
We built this because I was tired of the app development process taking months before you could even see what you were building.
With vibecode you see it immediately. On your device. Working.
Go to vibecode.dev and build something right now.

## ==Test It On Your Phone in 10 Minutes V3==
Here's something most people don't know about building apps.
Before you can even test an app on your iPhone you normally need a Mac, Xcode, a developer account, provisioning profiles.
It's a nightmare and most people quit before they even get started.
We built vibecode.dev so you skip all of that.
You describe your app, the AI builds it, and you scan a QR code to test it on your phone.
That's it. No setup. No developer account. No $99 Apple fee just to see if your idea works.
Go to vibecode.dev and test your app idea in minutes.

## ==Turn Your App Into a Business==
Thousands of people are now vibe coding mobile apps and putting their apps on the app store. 
But most of them forget the most important part.
Getting paid.
That's why we built payments directly into vibecode.dev.
You describe your app, the AI builds it, and then you simply flip on a paywall with RevenueCat. It takes 5 minutes.
Subscriptions, one-time purchases, free trials, whatever you want.
People are making real money from apps they built in a single afternoon.
We built this app because your app shouldn't just be a side project. It should be a business.
Go to vibecode.dev and start building.

## ==Turn Your App Into a Business V2==
Everyone's vibe coding apps right now.
But here's what nobody talks about.
Most of those apps don't make a single dollar.
When we built vibecode.dev we made sure you could add payments in minutes.
You just connect RevenueCat, set up a subscription or a one-time purchase, and you're done.
Your users open the app, hit the paywall, and you get paid.
We've seen people go from zero to revenue in the same day they built their app.
That's why we built this. Not just to help you build apps but to help you build a business.
Go to vibecode.dev and try it for free.

## ==Turn Your App Into a Business V3==
Someone DMed me last week and said they built an app on vibecode and made $1,000 in their first month.
From an app they built in one sitting.
That's not rare anymore. We're seeing it all the time.
The reason is he used vibecode.dev to build this app. 
And Vibecode has a RevenueCat integration built in.
So adding a paywall takes minutes, not weeks.
You don't need to figure out StoreKit or Google Play billing or any of that.
You just toggle it on, pick your price, and your app is ready to charge users so you can make money. 
Go to vibecode.dev and see for yourself.

## ==Claude Opus 4.6 Builds Apps==
Oh my god Claude Opus 4.6 is so good at building mobile apps in vibecode.dev.
I'm not even exaggerating.
I described a full app with a database, payments, and push notifications and it just built the whole thing.
No errors. No going back and forth. It planned the entire architecture and wrote it all in one shot.
This is the most powerful AI coding model on the planet and it's what powers vibecode.
Other vibe coding tools use cheap models and you can tell.
Go to vibecode.dev and see what a real AI model can do.

## ==One Prompt Full App==
Oh my god Claude Opus 4.6 is so good at building entire apps from a single prompt in vibecode.dev.
I typed one sentence. One.
And it built a fully working app with auth, a database, and a paywall.
Most AI tools need you to babysit them through ten rounds of edits.
Opus 4.6 reads your prompt, plans the whole thing, writes the code, and catches its own bugs.
That's why vibecode feels different. It's the model.
Go to vibecode.dev and try one prompt. That's all you need.

## ==I Watched Someone Build an App Who's Never Written a Line of Code==
I sat next to someone who has never written a single line of code in their life.
I told them to go to vibecode.dev and describe an app.
They typed "I want a meal planning app with a grocery list and calorie tracker."
And I watched the AI build the entire thing. Right in front of us.
Database, UI, the whole app. Working.
They looked at me and said "there's no way this is real."
It's real. And that's why we built vibecode.
You don't need to know how to code. You just need to know what you want.
Go to vibecode.dev and try it yourself.

## ==The App Store Is Wide Open==
Everyone thinks the App Store is too crowded.
That there's no room left.
That's completely wrong.
There are millions of tiny niches with zero good apps.
Dog walkers, piano teachers, local gyms, book clubs.
These people need simple apps and nobody's building them.
That's why I built vibecode.dev.
You describe a niche app, the AI builds the whole thing, and you can have it on the App Store in days.
Some of the best businesses aren't billion dollar ideas. They're small apps that solve one specific problem.
Go to vibecode.dev and build the app nobody else is building.

## ==Stop Wireframing==
I see this all the time.
Someone has an app idea so they open Figma and spend three weeks designing every screen.
Then they need a developer to actually build it. So they wait another three months.
And 99% of the time it never even gets built.
Stop wireframing. Just build it.
Go to vibecode.dev, describe what you want, and the AI builds a real working app.
Not a mockup. Not a prototype. The actual app.
You can design in Figma for a month or you can have a real app on your phone in 20 minutes.
I built vibecode because I was tired of watching good ideas die in a Figma file.

## ==I Dare You to Describe an App==
I dare you to go to vibecode.dev right now and describe the weirdest, most specific app you can think of.
An app that rates public bathrooms. An app that tracks how many times your dog barks. I don't care.
Type it in and watch what happens.
The AI will just build it. The whole thing. Database, UI, everything.
That's the thing about vibecode. It doesn't matter how niche or how weird your idea is.
If you can describe it, it can build it.
We built this because we wanted everyone to be able to build whatever they want.
Go to vibecode.dev. I dare you.

## ==I'm About to Put Developers Out of Work==
I'm probably going to get hate for this but I don't care.
Vibecode.dev is going to put a lot of developers out of work.
Not the great ones. Not the ones building complex systems at Google.
But the ones charging $15,000 to build a simple app that takes them three months?
Yeah. That's over.
Because now anyone can go to vibecode.dev, describe their app, and have it built in minutes.
Real native code. Database, payments, the whole thing.
I didn't build vibecode to hurt developers. I built it because regular people were getting ripped off.
And now they don't have to be.
Go to vibecode.dev.

# **Web**
## ==Internal Tool==
I kept hearing from teams that waited two, three weeks for engineering to build one simple internal tool.
Every time.
So I built vibecode.dev to fix that.
You describe the tool you need, connect it to your database, and you've got a working app in about 20 minutes.
No tickets, no sprint planning, no waiting on developers.
I built this because your team shouldn't be blocked by engineering for simple tools.
Just go to vibecode.dev and build it yourself.

## ==Dashboard in a Day==
I built vibecode.dev because I kept seeing the same problem.
Project managers, ops people, team leads, all waiting on engineering for basic tools.
You shouldn't need to be a developer to build a dashboard.
With vibecode you just describe what you need and the AI builds a full web app.
Real-time data, filters, charts, the whole thing.
Connect it to Supabase and share it with your team the same day.
I built this so you never have to beg engineering for a simple tool again.

## ==Launch a SaaS==
I know so many people who want to start a SaaS but they're stuck.
It's either learn to code or pay someone $10k.
That's why I built vibecode.dev.
You describe your SaaS idea and the AI builds the whole web app.
User accounts, a database, Stripe payments, a landing page, everything.
People are getting paying customers within a week.
I built this because starting a SaaS business shouldn't cost you $10,000.
Go to vibecode.dev and launch the thing.

## ==Claude Opus 4.6 Builds Web Apps==
Oh my god Claude Opus 4.6 is so good at building web apps in vibecode.dev.
I described a full SaaS with user accounts, Stripe payments, and a dashboard.
It built the whole thing. Frontend, backend, database, everything.
And it actually works. No broken pages, no missing logic.
That's because Opus 4.6 plans your app before it writes a single line of code and then reviews its own work.
No other vibe coding tool uses a model this good.
Go to vibecode.dev and build a real web app.

# **Full Stack**
## ==The Only Full Stack Vibe Coding Platform==
Every vibe coding tool out there does one thing.
They'll build you a website. Or maybe a landing page.
But that's it. You're on your own for everything else.
We built vibecode.dev to be the first full stack vibe coding platform.
That means you can build mobile apps and web apps. 
Just describe the app you want. 
Mobile app, Frontend, backend, database, auth, payments, deployment.
The whole stack. Not just a pretty screen with nothing behind it.
Other tools give you a demo. Vibecode gives you a real product.
If you're tired of stitching five different tools together just to launch something, go to vibecode.dev.
It's the only platform that builds the whole thing.
