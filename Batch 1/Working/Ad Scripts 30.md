## 1. The 2AM Screenshot

Someone sent me a screenshot at 2am last night.

They made $847 in their first week.

From an app they built on vibecode.dev.

No code. No developer. They just described what they wanted.

This happens more than you'd think.

People are building apps in an afternoon and making real money from them within days.

The app had a database, a clean UI, and a ==[BROLL: RevenueCat paywall]==.

They set the price. Users subscribed. That's it.

I built vibecode because I wanted regular people to be able to do this.

Go to vibecode.dev and see what you can build.

---

## 2. I Quit My Job

Someone told me they quit their job last month.

Because of an app they built on vibecode.dev.

It hit $3k a month. An app they built in a weekend.

Three thousand dollars. Every month. From something they made in two days.

They weren't a developer. They were a marketing manager with a small following on LinkedIN.

They described their app idea. The AI built it. They added a paywall. Users started paying.

And now they're working for themselves.

We didn't build vibecode to help people make little side projects.

I built it so people could change their lives and build apps that other people want.

Go to vibecode.dev to try it.

---

## 3. I Get DMs Every Day

I get DMs every single day from people who built apps on vibecode.dev.

Some of them are making money. Some of them just shipped something for the first time ever.

One guy built an ==[BROLL: app for his local gym]==. Another made a ==[BROLL: habit tracker]== for himself and now has 2,000 users.

A mom built a ==[BROLL: chore chart app]== for her kids.

These aren't developers. These are regular people.

The only difference is they tried.

They described something and watched it get built.

I made vibecode because I believe everyone has an app inside them.

Go to vibecode.dev and let it out.

---

# SECTION 2: CONTRARIAN & HOT TAKES (Scripts 4-8)

---

## 4. AI Isn't Replacing Developers

Everyone says AI is coming for developers.

They're wrong.

It's coming for the agencies charging you $15,000 for a basic app.

It's coming for the freelancers who take three months and ghost you halfway through.

Great developers aren't going anywhere.

But the gatekeepers? The ones making app development feel impossible?

Their time is up.

That's why we built vibecode.dev.

So you don't need to beg or pay someone just to test your idea.

You describe it. The AI builds it. You own it.

Go to vibecode.dev.

---

## 5. The App Store Gold Rush

We're in the middle of a gold rush and nobody's talking about it.

The App Store is full of empty niches.

==[BROLL: Apps that haven't been updated in three years. Apps with terrible UX. Apps that barely work.]==

And right now, anyone can build something better.

In an afternoon.

The big companies haven't caught on yet. The competition is asleep.

But that window is closing.

I built vibecode.dev so you can build ==[BROLL: niche apps]== before everyone else wakes up.

Stop waiting. The gold is there.

Go to vibecode.dev and stake your claim.

---

## 6. Your Employer Doesn't Want You to Know This

Your company probably pays $50,000 a year for internal tools.

==[BROLL: Custom dashboards. Admin panels. Reporting apps.]==

What if I told you that you could build most of them yourself in an afternoon?

That's exactly what vibecode.dev does.

You describe the tool. Connect it to your database. Done.

No engineering team. No six-week sprint. No budget approvals.

I built this because companies are wasting insane amounts of money.

And employees are waiting months for simple tools.

Take back control.

Go to vibecode.dev.

---

## 7. Everyone Is Wrong About Ideas

Everyone says "ideas are worthless, execution is everything."

That's only half true.

The reason ideas felt worthless is because execution was so hard.

You had to know how to code. Or pay someone who did. Or beg for help.

But now?

Now you can go to vibecode.dev and execute on your idea in an hour.

The barrier is gone.

Ideas matter again. Because now you can actually build them.

Stop letting your ideas rot in a notes app.

Go to vibecode.dev and build something.

---

## 8. Vibe Coding Is Not a Trend

People keep asking me if vibe coding is a fad.

No. It's the new default.

The same way no one writes assembly code anymore.

The same way drag-and-drop replaced manual HTML.

This is just the next step.

AI writes code now. And it does it well.

Vibecode.dev is how you use that power to build real apps.

==[BROLL: Mobile apps. Web apps. Full stack.]==

This isn't going away. It's only getting better.

Get on now or get left behind.

---

# SECTION 3: COMPARISON & BEFORE/AFTER (Scripts 9-13)

---

## 9. The Old Way vs. The Vibecode Way

Here's how building an app used to work.

You had an idea. You searched for a developer. You got quoted $15,000. You waited three months. You got something that barely worked. You paid extra to fix it.

Here's how it works now.

You go to vibecode.dev. You describe what you want. You have a working app in 20 minutes. You ==[BROLL: test it on your phone]==.

That's the difference.

I built vibecode because the old way was broken.

Go see for yourself.

---

## 10. Your Figma File vs. Your App

Show me your ==[BROLL: Figma file]==.

It's beautiful. Every screen polished. Every button perfect.

Now show me your ==[BROLL: app]==.

Oh wait. It doesn't exist.

I see this all the time.

People spend weeks designing something they never ship.

Then the idea dies.

Stop wireframing.

Go to vibecode.dev, describe your app, and have a real working version on your phone in 20 minutes.

Figma files don't make money. Apps do.

---

## 11. I Tested Every AI App Builder

I spent $500 testing every vibe coding tool I could find.

Most of them build web pages. That's it.

Some of them give you broken code and expect you to fix it.

Others look cool in demos but fall apart on anything real.

Vibecode.dev was different.

It built ==[BROLL: full native apps. Database, auth, payments, the whole thing]==.

And it actually worked.

That's why I'm here.

Stop wasting time on tools that half-work.

Go to vibecode.dev.

---

## 12. The $15,000 Quote

Someone showed me a quote last week.

$15,000 for a simple ==[BROLL: iOS app]==.

I laughed. Then I felt bad for them.

Because I knew they could build the same thing on vibecode.dev for about $50.

Real native app. Database. Payments. The whole thing.

I'm not saying all developers are overcharging.

But some of them absolutely are.

And you don't need to play that game anymore.

Go to vibecode.dev.

---

## 13. Three Months vs. Three Minutes

Traditional way: hire a developer, wait three months, pay $20,000, hope it works.

Vibecode way: describe your app, watch the AI build it, ==[BROLL: test it on your phone]== in minutes.

That's not a small difference.

That's a total reset on what's possible.

I built vibecode.dev because I was tired of seeing people wait half a year for something that should take an afternoon.

The old timeline is dead.

Go to vibecode.dev and build something right now.

---

# SECTION 4: EDUCATIONAL & VALUE-FIRST (Scripts 14-18)

## 14. The 3 Types of Apps That Make Money

Most apps fail. But there are three types that actually work.

One. ==[BROLL: Utility apps]== that solve one small problem really well.

Two. ==[BROLL: Niche apps]== for specific communities that nobody else is serving.

Three. ==[BROLL: Tool apps]== that save time or make something easier.

These don't need to be complex. They need to be focused.

The good news? Vibecode.dev builds all three.

You describe it. Add a paywall. Start charging.

I built this so you can focus on finding the right idea instead of worrying about how to build it.

Go to vibecode.dev and pick your lane.

---

## 15. Why Your App Idea Failed

Your idea was probably good.

Here's what actually went wrong.

You tried to learn to code and gave up after a week.

Or you hired someone and it took six months.

Or you got overwhelmed by all the technical stuff you didn't understand.

The idea wasn't the problem. The barrier to execution was.

That's exactly what vibecode.dev removes.

You describe it. The AI builds it. You skip all the painful parts.

Your next idea doesn't have to die like the last one.

Go to vibecode.dev.

---

## 16. How to Find App Ideas That Sell

Here's how I find app ideas.

Go to the App Store. Search a niche. Look at the reviews of the top apps.

Every one-star review is a feature request.

Every complaint is an opportunity.

Now go build that.

That's the thing about vibecode.dev.

Once you know what people want, you can build it the same day.

Not next quarter. Not after a funding round. Today.

Find the gap. Fill it.

Go to vibecode.dev.

---

## 17. You Don't Need to Learn Swift

People ask me all the time what language they should learn to build iOS apps.

My answer? None.

You don't need to learn Swift. You don't need to learn React Native.

You just need to go to vibecode.dev and describe what you want.

The AI writes the code. Real native code. Production ready.

Learning to code is great if you want to. But it's not required anymore.

The barrier is gone.

Go to vibecode.dev.

---

## 18. The Fastest Way to Validate an Idea

Here's how most people validate app ideas.

They talk about it for six months. Ask their friends. Maybe post a survey.

Then they never build it.

Here's the faster way.

Go to vibecode.dev. Describe the app. Build it in an hour. Show it to people.

That's real validation.

Not "would you use this?" but "here it is, do you want it?"

I built vibecode because talking about ideas doesn't work.

Building them does.

# SECTION 5: HEARTFELT & APPRECIATIVE (Scripts 19-28)

## 19. I Never Expected This

When I started building vibecode, I didn't know if anyone would use it.

It was just an idea. A bet.

I thought maybe a few people would try it.

Now I get messages every day from people who built something they're proud of.

==[BROLL: Apps they put on the App Store]==. Tools they use for their business. Side projects that became real income.

I never expected this.

And honestly, I'm just grateful.

Grateful that this thing we made actually helps people.

If you haven't tried it yet, go to vibecode.dev.

And if you have, thank you.

---

## 20. This Is Why I Built It

I get asked why I built vibecode.

The honest answer is that I was frustrated.

I watched people with amazing ideas get stuck because they couldn't code.

I watched them pay too much. Wait too long. Give up.

And I thought there has to be a better way.

That's what this is.

A way for anyone to build the thing they've been dreaming about.

When I see someone ship their first app, it still hits me.

That's why I built this.

Go to vibecode.dev and build something.

---

## 21. Thank You for Being Here

I just want to take a second and say thank you.

To everyone who's tried vibecode.

To everyone who's given feedback, reported bugs, and helped us get better.

To everyone who believed this was possible before it was obvious.

We've built something real here. Together.

And I don't take that for granted.

This isn't just a product to me. It's a community.

If you're part of it, thank you.

If you're not yet, come join us at vibecode.dev.

---

## 22. Watching People Ship

The best part of my job is watching people ship.

Someone who's never written a line of code puts an ==[BROLL: app on the App Store]==.

Someone who's been sitting on an idea for years finally builds it.

Someone messages me and says "I can't believe I made this."

That's the good stuff.

That's why we built vibecode.dev.

Not for the technology. For the moment when someone realizes they can actually do this.

If you've been holding back, stop.

Go to vibecode.dev and see what happens.

---

## 23. The Community Built This

I get too much credit for vibecode.

The truth is, this thing was built by a community.

People who tried it early and told us what was broken.

People who pushed us to add features we didn't think of.

People who believed in this when it was rough around the edges.

Every day I see people in our Discord helping each other.

Sharing tips. Celebrating wins. Supporting strangers.

That's the real magic.

The tool is just a tool. The community is everything.

Come be part of it at vibecode.dev.

---

## 24. We're Just Getting Started

When I look at where vibecode is now, I smile.

Then I think about where it's going and I get excited.

We've already helped thousands of people build apps.

But we're just getting started.

Every week we're adding new features. Making it faster. Making it easier.

This thing is going to keep getting better.

And I'm grateful for everyone who's on this ride with us.

If you haven't tried it yet, this is a good time to jump in.

Go to vibecode.dev.

---

## 25. I Still Can't Believe This Works

Sometimes I still can't believe this works.

You type a sentence. AI builds a real app. You ==[BROLL: test it on your phone]==.

A few years ago this wasn't possible.

Now it's just Tuesday.

I'm grateful to be building at this moment in time.

Grateful for the team. Grateful for the users. Grateful that the technology caught up to the vision.

If you've ever had an idea and thought "I can't build that," try again.

Go to vibecode.dev.

The rules have changed.

---

## 26. It's Not About the Tool

Vibecode is just a tool.

The real magic is what you do with it.

I've seen people build apps for their communities, their families, their businesses.

Apps that solve problems no one else was solving.

Apps that make lives a little bit easier.

That's not vibecode. That's you.

We just gave you a way to make it happen.

Thank you for bringing your ideas to life.

If you haven't yet, go to vibecode.dev.

And then go build something that matters.

---

## 27. More Than Downloads

When I see vibecode's numbers, the downloads, the apps built, the revenue, that's cool.

But that's not what I think about.

I think about the person who finally shipped something after years of trying.

The founder who launched without needing to raise money.

The parent who made an ==[BROLL: app for their kid]==.

Numbers don't tell those stories.

People do.

And I'm grateful for every single one of you.

Thank you for being here.

If you haven't tried vibecode.dev yet, I hope you will.

---

## 28. The Best Part of This Job

People ask me what I love most about building vibecode.

It's not the tech. It's not the growth.

It's the messages.

Someone sends me a screenshot of their ==[BROLL: app on the App Store]==.

Someone tells me they made their first dollar online.

Someone says "I've been trying to do this for five years and I finally did it."

That's the best part.

Knowing this thing actually helps people.

I'm genuinely grateful. Every day.

Thank you for trusting us with your ideas.

Go to vibecode.dev and make something great.
