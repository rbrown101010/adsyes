# Ad Concepts

## Standard
1. **Your App Idea Is Expiring** — The longer you sit on it, the more likely someone else builds it first. Urgency/FOMO angle. (no)
2. **I Watched Someone Build an App Who's Never Written a Line of Code** — Reaction/proof angle. Riley watches a non-technical person use vibecode for the first time on camera. (yes)
3. **The App Store Is Wide Open** — Most people think the App Store is saturated. It's not. Niche apps with small audiences make real money every day. You just need to build one. (yes)
4. **Stop Wireframing** — People spend weeks in Figma designing screens for apps that never get built. Skip the mockup and just build the real thing. (yes)
5. **Your Freelance Clients Will Never Know** — Aimed at freelancers/agencies. You can deliver real apps to clients and they'll think you have a dev team behind you. (no)

## Outside the Box
6. **I Dare You to Describe an App** — Direct challenge to the viewer. "Type anything. I don't care how weird or specific it is. Vibecode will build it." Turns it into a game. (yes)
7. **This App Was Built by a Dentist** — Highlight a bizarre/unexpected user. A dentist, a teacher, a florist — someone you'd never expect built a legit app. Makes it feel real and accessible. (yes)
8. **The App That Pays for Your Groceries** — Forget "side project." Frame a vibecode app as a boring, practical passive income stream. Like a vending machine but digital. (no)
9. **I'm About to Put Developers Out of Work (And I'm Sorry)** — Intentionally provocative/controversial hook designed to stop the scroll and spark comments. Riley addresses it head on. (yes)
10. **Build an App Before This Video Ends** — Real-time speed challenge. The entire ad IS the demo. Riley starts a timer, describes an app, and it's done before the video is over. (no)
