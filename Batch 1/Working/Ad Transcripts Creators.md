## Stop Paying Developers
People pay developers 10, 15, sometimes $20,000 for custom iOS app. They wait months and half the time it doesn't even work right. But here's the thing. You can just go to vibeco.dev and type whatever your app idea is. And the most powerful AI coding models in the world will start building your app. Then you can test it, add a database, or even add payments so that people can pay for your app. You can get a professional app just by describing it and save five figures using vibecode.dev.
## Real Apps Not Web Demos
Everyone's out here vibe coding websites and little web demos.
But nobody's talking about building real apps.
Like actual apps that go on the App Store.
I found vibecode.dev and I just described the app I wanted to build.
The AI started writing real native code, not some janky web wrapper.
I added a database, turned on push notifications, and even added a paywall so users can pay me and all of this only took 20 minutes, not months.
If you have an app idea, stop sitting on it.
Go to vibecode.dev and just build it.
## The $200 App
Someone just sent me a quote for $12,000 to build a simple app.
Twelve thousand dollars.
So instead I went to vibecode.dev and just described what I wanted.
The AI started building the whole thing right in front of me.
I'm talking real native code, a database, even a payment system so users can subscribe.
I tested it on my phone and it looked like a real developer built it.
The whole thing cost me about 200 bucks. Stop paying developers thousands of dollars.
Go to vibecode.dev and build it yourself.
## The App Idea You Keep Telling People About
You know that app idea you've been telling everyone about?
At dinners, at bars, in every group chat.
"Bro, someone should build this."
Yeah. You've been saying that for two years.
Here's the thing. You can literally go to vibecode.dev right now, describe your idea, and the AI will start building it.
Real native code. Not a prototype. Not a mockup. A real app.
Add a database, add payments, test it on your phone.
You could have this thing built before the weekend.
Stop talking about your app idea and go to vibecode.dev and actually build it.
## Founder No CTO
Everyone says you need a technical cofounder to launch a startup.
That you can't build an app without a developer on your team.
That's not true anymore.
I went to vibecode.dev, described my entire MVP, and the AI built it.
I'm talking database, user auth, push notifications, even a paywall with RevenueCat.
I launched my app in a weekend. No cofounder, no agency, no five-figure invoice.
If you're a founder sitting on an idea because you can't code, go to vibecode.dev. You don't need a CTO. You need vibecode.

## Internal Tool
My team used to wait two, three weeks for engineering to build us one simple internal tool.
Every time. So I tried vibecode.dev.
I described the tool we needed, connected it to our database, and had a working app in about 20 minutes. 
No tickets, no sprint planning, no waiting on developers. 
If your company wastes time waiting on engineering for simple tools, just go to vibecode.dev and build it yourself. It's that easy.
## Dashboard in a Day
My boss asked me to build a dashboard to track our sales pipeline. 
I'm not a developer. I'm a project manager. 
But I went to vibecode.dev, described exactly what we needed, and the AI built a full web app. Real-time data, filters, charts, the whole thing. I connected it to our Supabase database and shared it with the team that same afternoon. My boss thought I hired someone. I didn't. I used vibecode.dev. If you need an internal tool and you're tired of begging engineering, just go build it.
## Launch a SaaS
I've been wanting to start a SaaS for over a year. 
But every time I looked into it, it was either learn to code or pay someone $10k to build it. 
Then I found vibecode.dev. I described my SaaS idea, the AI built the whole web app. 
User accounts, a database, Stripe payments, a landing page, everything. 
I had paying customers within a week. 
A real SaaS business that I built by typing a description. 
If you've been sitting on a SaaS idea, stop overthinking it. 
Go to vibecode.dev and launch the thing.
