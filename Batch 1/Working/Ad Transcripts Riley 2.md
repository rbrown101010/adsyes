# **Agentic Apps**
## ==Your App Can Now Think== 
Vibe Coding Just changed forever.
You can now build agentic apps, using the Claude Code SDK. 
Meaning you can now put Claude Code inside the apps that you make.
And you can do it with a single prompt inside Vibecode.dev. 
Most apps just sit there and wait for the user to tap buttons. They are static.
An agentic app has a brain. Think Cursor or Claude Code but inside your app.
We added the Claude SDK directly into Vibecode so now you can build a side panel right inside your app that has the full power of Claude Code.
Claude Code can read files, write to databases, search the internet, generate code, analyze data, and basically do anything a developer can do all inside of an app that you generate. 
You can create the 
1. Claude Code for slide decks 
2. Claude Code for spreadsheets
3. Claude Code for company internal data
And you don't need to know how any of this works. You just select Claude SDK when you're building in Vibecode.dev and the AI handles the rest.
Go to vibecode.dev and build an app that actually does something.

## ==Claude Code But Inside Your App==
You know how Claude Code can read files, search the internet, write code, and basically do anything?
What if you could put that inside your own app that you vibe code...
That's now possible. 
Vibecode.dev now has a Claude Code integration which allows you to build an app that uses the power of Claude Code... INSIDE your app. 
You describe an app, select Claude Code integration, and now your app has a side panel with the full power of Claude Code baked into it.
Claude Code for spreadsheets. 
Claude Code for slide decks. 
Claude Code for whatever you want.
One prompt. One app. An actual AI agent running inside of it.
Go to vibecode.dev and try it.

## ==Nobody Else Is Doing This==
Every vibe coding tool out there builds you a static app. 
You click buttons, you see screens, that's it.
Well we just made it so your app can actually think.
Vibecode.dev now lets you add the Claude Code SDK to any app you build.
That means you can put an agent in your app.
This agent can read files. Search the web. Analyze data. Generate entire documents.
Someone built a research app last week that pulls articles from the internet and writes full reports. 
Someone built an agent based video editor using powered by Claude Code. 
And all they had to do was select the Claude Code integration, and then type their agentic app idea.
You can try this right now on vibecode.dev, go build your agentic app.
